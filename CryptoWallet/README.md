TODO:
- Add a form for converting crypto. Convert from one crypto to another according to current price.
- Add a display for the current holdings of the user and whether said holdings have increased in value or
decreased, shown in green or red percentage.
- Add a form for withdrawing crypto from the system.
- Create a function that calls the python script for taking in the stock data from yfinance.
- Maybe create a transaction class which will hold information about the current price at the time and the
gain or loss from that transaction.
